      "excerpt"		: "Most of us probably appreciate the importance of publication in academia. In my experience, PhD programs generally require at least one first author publication to graduate (many require two). Postdocs pursue publications to advance their research and careers, and university labs focus on publishing as a key output of their research. This may sound familiar in the academic setting, but what about industry? What does publication look like for a scientist doing research in a company? Without being in industry, I don’t think it’s always clear how industry scientists balance publications with their other therapeutic priorities. In this post we will explore what it means to publish research in industry."

There is what we can call the academic path (assistant professor, etc) but what about other paths like industry (pharma, biotech, etc)? I found (and I think many others do too) academia to be a bit clearer because we spend so much time in the University system during our scientific training. Conversely I think a lot of times industry can be a bit more of a black box, with details and perspectives somewhat elusive. Throughout my graduate and postdoc training, I really benefited from insightful, supportive, and generous colleagues who shared this information and helped me make an informed decision about where I wanted to go in my career. Since joining industry as a computational biologist after my postdoc, I’ve been passionate about paying it forward and trying to be a resource for others who want to learn more."

Pink is a popular writer and his work (most notably his book Drive) outlines three key “MAP” motivators: Mastery (we want to get better at stuff), Autonomy (we want to direct our lives), and Purpose (we want to contribute to something big and meaningful). For this post we will take some time to discuss and reflect on the MAP criteria for motivation, and how we can use them to motivate our research."

One layer of this complicated system is the functionality of bacteria within the microbiome. Small molecules, often produced by microbial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), are an avenue many groups are now taking to further elucidate this functionality. As we discussed in this blog before, BGCs are clusters of co-localized genes that together encode the “machinery” needed to produce small molecules that can impact functionality of either human cells or other microbial cells. In this blog post we will discuss the recently reported work of Aleti et al, in which they reported an analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the oral microbiome, and its association with oral disease. The group’s disease focus was on periodontitis and dental plaques, which are significant disease burdens."

The approach termed phage therapy involves the use of phages to therapeutically to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria and thereby treat resistant, life-threatening infections. These phage-based approaches are also appealing in applications such as “microbiome sparing” therapies for infections, which means the specific infectious bacterium is killed by the phage and the overall community is impacted less than by an antibiotic treatment. For these reasons, it is important for us as a field to understand how phages infect their hosts, and how bacteria evade phage infections. A recently published manuscript by Sarah Kronheim et al addresses our knowledge gap of how bacteria combat phage infections by outlining a previously understudied chemical-based bacterial defense mechanism against phages."

These new perspectives are already beginning to inform promising new therapies for truly terrible diseases (i.e. Clostridium difficile infections). Although the microbiome consists of fungi, viruses, archaea, and other microbes, bacteria are by and large the most studied component of the human microbiome. The human virome (the viral component of the human microbiome) is understudied, but especially interesting because it consists primarily of bacteriophages (bacterial viruses), which are capable of modulating bacterial metabolism, function, and community composition."

To date, the majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacteria, but microbiomes are actually complex communities that consist of fungi, archaea, viruses, and of course bacteria. The bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) component of the human microbiome is of particular interest to human health because of the profound influence bacteriophages have on bacterial community composition and functionality. As an example, phages facilitate bacterial virulence in Cholera and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Despite their importance, we are still just scratching the surface into how phages interact with the human body to impact health. By understanding these phage - bacteria - human interactions better, we can better understand how the microbiome impacts human health, and how we can create microbiome-based therapies."

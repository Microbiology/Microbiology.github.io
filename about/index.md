### About the Blog
Welcome to "Prophage", the blog all about bacteria, phages (bacterial viruses), computers, and science!  The three goals of this blog are to provide thoughtful discussions about current scientific topics and literature, to offer insight into the life of a biomedical scientist by outlining some of my own experiences, and to supply interesting and helpful resources that others will find useful.  I am doing this by posting essays, thoughts, notes and ideas every few days.  By keeping the focus of Prophage broad, I will continue to write about what I find interesting, and continue to introduce you to new and exciting topics.  Thanks for reading and enjoy! 

*NOTE*: This is a personal blog and all opinions & views are my own.

One layer of this complicated system is the functionality of bacteria within the microbiome. Small molecules, often produced by microbial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), are an avenue many groups are now taking to further elucidate this functionality. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://microbiology.github.io/blog/bgc-transcript-pnas/&quot;&gt;we discussed in this blog before&lt;/a&gt;, BGCs are clusters of co-localized genes that together encode the “machinery” needed to produce small molecules that can impact functionality of either human cells or other microbial cells. In this blog post we will discuss &lt;a href=&quot;https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/2/e00321-19&quot;&gt;the recently reported work of Aleti &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which they reported an analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the oral microbiome, and its association with oral disease. The group’s disease focus was on periodontitis and dental plaques, which are significant disease burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study the biosynthetic gene clusters in the oral microbiome, the researchers generated a database of 461 oral bacteria reference genomes and used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/#!/start&quot;&gt;AntiSMASH&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure to identify BGCs within those genomes. The majority of BGC classes were unsurprisingly unclassifiable, although the group was able to infer classes of some of those BGCs by aligning them to the BGCs within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org&quot;&gt;MiBIG database&lt;/a&gt; of 1400 reference BGCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/BGC-network-analysis-oral-microbiome.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Networks were used to identify and visualize similarities between the MiBIG BGC reference database and BGCs predicted from bacterial reference genomes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once their BGC reference set was complete, the scientists curated a dataset of metagenomic (DNA; functional potential) and meta-transcriptomic (RNA; functional gene expression) information from saliva and dental plaques of 294 subjects who were either healthy, had dental caries, or periodontitis. Alignment of the metagenomic and meta-transcriptomic sequences to the BGC database allowed the group to identify differentially abundant/expressed BGCs between the disease states. The group was also able to follow up with some metabolic analysis (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_chromatography–mass_spectrometry&quot;&gt;LC-MS/MS&lt;/a&gt;) to find and validate some signals in the microbiome. Finally, a co-abundance network analysis revealed numerous correlations between BGCs and bacterial taxonomic groups. Most correlations were negative, which the authors suggest reflects antagonistic antimicrobial BGC relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting study that highlights the prevalence of BGCs within the oral microbiome, and the association of those BGCs with oral disease states. The specific disease-associated BGC classes will likely inform hypotheses for the field (these details are beyond the scope of this blog post and can be read in the original manuscript). This paper is particularly notable for how it sets up future studies. In addition to predicting BGCs from reference genomes, it would valuable for future studies to apply the supplemental approach of predicting BGCs from &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; assemblies from the metagenomic data. Additionally, it would be good to focus on the BGCs that are associated with other interactions beyond those with bacterial taxa. BGC associations with host functions and other microbes, such as fungi, would offer a new level of understanding to the complex system.&lt;/p&gt;

The approach termed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy&quot;&gt;phage therapy&lt;/a&gt; involves the use of phages to therapeutically to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria and thereby treat resistant, life-threatening infections. These phage-based approaches are also appealing in applications such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5609231/#mbt212783-bib-0021&quot;&gt;“microbiome sparing” therapies&lt;/a&gt; for infections, which means the specific infectious bacterium is killed by the phage and the overall community is impacted less than by an antibiotic treatment. For these reasons, it is important for us as a field to understand how phages infect their hosts, and how bacteria evade phage infections. A recently published manuscript by Sarah Kronheim &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; addresses our knowledge gap of how bacteria combat phage infections by outlining a previously understudied chemical-based bacterial defense mechanism against phages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of Kronheim &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; began with an observation in the scientific literature from decades in the past (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00021369.1979.10863874&quot;&gt;here is a link to one of them&lt;/a&gt;). That past work noted that bacteriophages were inactivated by bacterial &lt;a href=&quot;http://microbiology.github.io/blog/bgc-transcript-pnas/&quot;&gt;secondary metabolites&lt;/a&gt;, which were otherwise of medical interest because of their anti-tumor and antibiotic properties. Although the past groups published their findings, they did not follow up with their work and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the small molecule mediated phage defense mechanisms. Kronheim &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; picked up where the past groups left off, and provided a more comprehensive understanding of those understudied mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/chem-phage-old-paper.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Work from Morita et al in 1979 provided some initial insights into the impact small molecule drugs have on phage infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kronheim group began their study by performing a small molecule screen to identify which compounds inhibited phage infection of bacteria (the small molecules were largely products of biosynthetic gene clusters, and some represented FDA approved drugs and bioactive molecules). The approach is illustrated in the &lt;strong&gt;figure below&lt;/strong&gt;, which is from the original publication. The screen was successful and the group identified a subset of small molecules that prevented phage infection of their bacterial host (&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;). In addition to their lab strains, the group confirmed that their observation could be reproduced with phages isolated from nature. They also confirmed that the small molecule inhibitors were produced by the bacteria by testing their media. Together this supports the relevance of their observation, and suggests that the small molecules are biologically relevant outside of the lab system and are actually produced by bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/chem-phage-screen.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration of the group's experimental screen setup, from their manuscript. Bacterial isolates (E. coli) were either cultured alone, with phages, or with phages and a small molecule compound. The growth curves were measured to determine which compounds prevented bacterial destruction from phages.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the mechanism by which the small molecules were operating, the group characterized the molecule functionality and identified them as intercalating agents. They further found that one of the molecules, daunorubicin, acted early in the infectious process, likely after injection of phage DNA into the bacterial cell, but before replication of that DNA. As was reported in the previously existing literature, this was specific for dsDNA phages, although it was observed across diverse phage families. Further work will be required to more completely characterize the underlying mechsnisms of this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this study is broadly applicable and we could imagine myriad directions and implications for the work. I am particularly interested in the implications this work will have for human microbiome studies, including both bacterial and viral communities. I wonder whether small molecule drugs or drug candidates having an impact on the microbiome through this mechanism of bacteriophage infection inhibition? I also wonder what implications this could have in our understanding of antibiotic resistance with different antibiotic drugs. Perhaps some antibiotics are more adept to inhibiting bacteriophage infections, and thereby further limit the potential for spread of antibiotic resistance genes through transduction (both generalized and specialized). And how are these metabolites linked to altered viromes, which are themselves associated with disease? There is a lot of opportunity for impactful and interesting future work from this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper was short, clear, and overall well written so I suggest you check it out (&lt;a href=&quot;https://rdcu.be/bcAgw&quot;&gt;find it here&lt;/a&gt;). The link should be open access, and was very kindly provided by the authors for sharing. I also recommend checking out the older paper that I linked above in the second paragraph, because it is interesting to get a baseline historical perspective on this most current work. Finally if I missed something, got it wrong, or if you have some other cool ideas, let me know in the comments, Twitter, email, or telegraph. I always love hearing from you and really appreciate any additional feedback or insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Recent Research" /><category term="Phages" /><category term="Virome" /><category term="Molecular Biology" /><category term="Natural Products" /><summary type="html">A recently published study outlines a chemical mechanism for phage infection defense in bacteria.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Publication: The Colorectal Cancer Virome</title><link href="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/recent-crc-virome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Publication: The Colorectal Cancer Virome" /><published>2018-12-15T17:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-15T17:10:00-05:00</updated><id>http://microbiology.github.io/blog/recent-crc-virome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/recent-crc-virome/">&lt;p&gt;This year has shaped up to be a busy but exciting year, and one of these exciting parts has been the opportunity to publish some of my work in the human microbiome/virome space. A couple of weeks ago our research group (from when I was at the University of Michigan) had our colon cancer virome preprint fully published in mBio, and I am really excited to see it out. For this post I want to highlight that work and provide a little extra commentary about how I think it fits in the field and where the work is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent paper was titled “Diagnostic Potential and Interactive Dynamics of the Colorectal Cancer Virome” and is freely available &lt;a href=&quot;https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/6/e02248-18&quot;&gt;here on the mBio website&lt;/a&gt;. Briefly, we resequenced a frozen archived stool sample set from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/canprevres/early/2014/08/06/1940-6207.CAPR-14-0129.full.pdf&quot;&gt;previously published paper from the same lab&lt;/a&gt;. The original Zackular study utilized 16S rRNA shotgun sequencing, but we went back and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on both the whole stool as well as VLP (virus-like particle) purified stool. We found that altered viral communities were associated with the cancer state, and that this signal was dominated by bacteriophages (bacterial specific viruses). The bacteriophages were not associated with particular pathogens such as &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;. This observation was interesting, but how do we interpret an association between bacteriophages and colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/hannigan-mbio-F6-large.jpg&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The final working hypothesis from our study. These panels summarize our thoughts on the results and represent interesting future directions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different ways in which the bacteriophage communities could impact colorectal cancer progression, and we outlined some of those in a working hypothesis diagram (see figure above). Based on our findings and previous publications, we hypothesize the phages may be indirectly impacting colorectal cancer progression by contributing to the bacterial community dynamics. The bacteriophages could be causing the initial shifts in bacterial community composition, which in turn contribute to initial cancer progression. The phages could also be contributing to the cancer-associated biofilm dynamics and structure, as well as bacterial lysis and nutrient availability. It is interesting to consider these results in the context of previous literature that outlines the impact of different antibiotics on colorectal cancer progression. Because phages can also kill bacteria, they may impact cancer progression through a similar mechanism as what was observed in the different antibiotic treatments. There are many exciting and important directions in which this work can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately the same time we published this work out of preprint, the group of Nakatsu &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; published another study which also looked at the gut virome association with colorectal cancer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508518304797&quot;&gt;paper can be found here&lt;/a&gt;). This work offers some interesting additional perspectives to the underlying biology of our system. A big caveat to comparing the two studies is that the group used whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing (no VLP purification) and targeted their bioinformatics analysis toward virus reference genomes. This was unlike our Hannigan &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; paper that performed VLP purification and more of a &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; analysis approach. Despite the differences between the studies, both identified significant gut virome signatures associated with colorectal cancer, and together they provide compelling evidence for a role of the gut virome in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only am I excited about the work our group recently published, I am also very excited about the work coming out of other research groups and the overall direction of the field. In addition to these types of sequencing studies, I expect to see some follow up “mechanistic” work to address hypotheses like those we outlined above. Like other areas of microbiome research, I also expect to see future work begin to study signatures associated with microbes such as fungi or maybe even archaea. This will continue to be an interesting and medically important field to watch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Recent Research" /><category term="Colon Cancer" /><category term="Virome" /><category term="Microbiome" /><category term="Bioinformatics" /><category term="Computational Biology" /><summary type="html">Our recent publication, as well as others, support a role for the gut virome (specifically bacteriophage) in colorectal cancer.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Microbiome Natural Product Biosynthesis and Synthetic Orphans</title><link href="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/bgc-transcript-pnas/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Microbiome Natural Product Biosynthesis and Synthetic Orphans" /><published>2018-09-23T21:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-23T21:30:00-04:00</updated><id>http://microbiology.github.io/blog/bgc-transcript-pnas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/bgc-transcript-pnas/">&lt;p&gt;Wow, it’s been about six months since my last post and a lot has been happening! Between pushing through some papers and working on exciting projects in my new job in pharma, it’s been a busy summer. Unfortunately the blogging took a back seat but I’m excited to hop back onto the computer and hopefully keep the posts more frequent moving forward. So let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the exciting aspects of human microbiome research has been the continued improvment of &lt;strong&gt;functional analysis&lt;/strong&gt; of the communities through techniques such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. One approach to understanding microbiome functionality, which has recently been gaining more traction in the field, has been bacterial &lt;strong&gt;biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)&lt;/strong&gt;. This focus was especially apparent at recent microbiome/microbiology conferences, including the Beneficial Microbes conference and ASM Microbe conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGCs are co-localized gene clusters within bacterial genomes that together encode the machinery necessary for synthesis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_metabolite&quot;&gt;secondary metabolites&lt;/a&gt;. These metabolites have been widely used as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product&quot;&gt;natural product drugs&lt;/a&gt; and represent an important area in which the microbiome could be impacting its host. Additionally, bioinformatics techniques have been continuously developed to identify these signature clusters, and those techniques are starting to be utilized with microbiome datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/pnas.1714381115fig06.jpg&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One cool concept the paper mentions is the use of Operational Biosynthetic Units for evaluating diversity of the functional potential.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we can use bioinformatics tools to identify BGCs within bacterial genomes, there are still many challenges in the field. One of these major challenges is that a majority of BGCs remain &lt;strong&gt;orphans&lt;/strong&gt;, which means they have yet to be linked to their secondary metabolite products. A recent paper by Amos &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, published in PNAS and titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229817&quot;&gt;Comparative Transcriptomics as a Guide to Natural Product Discovery and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Functionality&lt;/a&gt;, used transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to provide important insights into orphan BGCs. This week will review some of the highlights from this study and briefly discuss the impact on the human microbiome field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of the paper focused on four strains of the bacterium actinomycete &lt;em&gt;Salinospora&lt;/em&gt;, marine bacteria which contain high numbers of BGCs. The group started by addressing the question of whether orphan BGC products are undetectable due to transcriptional silence (inactivity) in the laboratory. By performing global transcriptomic analyses (identification of which BGCs are active at the RNA expression level) and pairing it with metabolomic analysis (identification of metabolites, including BGC-produced secondary metabolites) at both stationary and growth phases, the group revealed an interesting phenomenon. While many BGCs were active at the gene transcript level (and therefore not silent), the BGC products (secondary metabolites) were still not readily identifiable. Although some orphan BGCs are the result of transcriptional inactivity (gene silence), this result highlights the important limitations of the other detection techniques such as LC/MS techniques, and the importance of understanding the transcriptional activity of the system being studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/pnas.1714381115fig03.jpg&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Comparison of bacterial strain genomes and their transcription profiles revealed other genomic elements whose presence influences BGC expression.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group followed up on this finding by investigating why some BGCs were differentially expressed between the bacterial strains. In other words, why was the same BGC transcriptionally active in one strain and not another highly similar strain? In one notable example, the group found that one orphan BGC was expressed when it included an activator (araC) upstream of the core BGC operon, and was silent when the activator was replaced with a different gene. This is an especially important result because it highlights our potential ability to use additional genes, such as upstream transcriptional activators, to predict which highly similar BGCs will be expressed in related bacterial genomes. This would be a valuable bioinformatics tool for informing the study of the human microbiome, as well as natural product drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this is a very interesting paper with a lot of insights into BGC activity and regulation. But why is this important from a human microbiome perspective? As a lot of groups in the field have already identified, BGC identification techniques from metagenomic datasets of the human microbiome offer an opportunity to identify largely unrecognized functional potential of the communities. The approach also offers implications for natural product discovery from such microbiome datasets. This paper further highlights the importance of integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses into such studies, so that a more accurate observation of the community activity can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Recent Research" /><category term="Natural Products" /><category term="Genomics" /><category term="Bioinformatics" /><summary type="html">Discussion of a recent study that provides new insights into orphan biosynthetic gene clusters, and the implications of those findings for the human microbiome.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Three Technologies With a Future In Computational Biology</title><link href="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/com-bio-tech/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Three Technologies With a Future In Computational Biology" /><published>2018-03-18T17:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-03-18T17:15:00-04:00</updated><id>http://microbiology.github.io/blog/com-bio-tech</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/com-bio-tech/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational biology is an exciting and diverse sub-field of biology that includes designing algorithms, exploring the human genome, making sense of the human microbiome. Even outside “computational biology”, all sorts of biologists are using computational approaches more and more, including performing analysis in R and processing data using custom Python scripts. At the heart of these computational applications are many powerful and wide-reaching technologies including programming languages (R and Python), code management tools (GitHub and BitBucket), and others. Because it’s always good practice to strive for the best in all aspects of our research, I want to spend this post reviewing some very powerful and promising technological tools that are poised to make large positive impacts on computational biology, as well as the field of biology in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;1. Docker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; is a wildly popular computing platform that allows users to build specialized virtual environments (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/what-container&quot;&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt;) that run a program of interest, regardless of the operating system or permissions. Do you want to run a Linux-only program on a Windows machine? Docker allows for that by enabling you to run the program in a temporary Linux environment (the container). Want to run a program on your high performance compute cluster but don’t want to deal with root access and system administrators? Go ahead and run it as a Docker container. Want to easily port your software with its associated reference databases? Containers can contain data in addition to the programs, so go ahead and include the reference in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/10/18/831f017c-ee68-4bd6-8a5c-ab31b4d35d6d/resize/770x/1cedcf2f03388a9720835a628a8a9765/dockerhero.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially Docker provides researchers total control over the programs they are running by allowing them to run those programs in small virtual environments that they completely control. Because each container image is custom built on top of a bare-bones operating system like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, the processing is incredibly light-weight and efficient (unlike virtual machines). In addition to Docker, there is a server-friendly sister platform called &lt;a href=&quot;http://singularity.lbl.gov&quot;&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt;, which provides an efficient and secure way to use Docker in a high performance computing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predict Docker is going to impact how we think about and conduct the computational processes around our biological research. A group of biologists have already started a project called BioContainers, which provides container images for many common biological analysis tools. Developers are continuing to make their programs available as Docker images as well, making usage as easy as typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker pull&lt;/code&gt; instead of installing myriad dependencies and navigating permission issues. I expect to see this more and more in biological research, and you should definitely check it out. It could probably enhance your own research as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;julia&quot;&gt;2. Julia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; has been an up-and-coming programming language over the years. Julia could be described as a powerful analytical language, similar in many ways to R and even Python. Julia is open source and offers simple syntax, insane speed and efficiency, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl&quot;&gt;notebook environment&lt;/a&gt; (Jupyter interactive environment), nice data visualization tools, and a growing set of resource packages. Its increased adoption in some pockets of machine learning and biological research, in addition to the other offerings, make it poised to become a go-to language for biologists in the near future. This is a language worth reading about and incorporating it into your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://biojulia.net/Contributing/latest/assets/logo.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reproducible-documents&quot;&gt;3. Reproducible Documents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us biologists have been observing an ever-growing enthusiasm for reproducible research, especially around the code we use in our published work. Every year more papers are publishing their code, and each year more journals are requiring code to be published with manuscripts. Not only does publishing code allow research results to be reproduced, but it also empowers others to implement similar analytical approaches. Apart from the altruistic enticements, reproducible code practices facilitate faster and more efficient research, increase confidence in the quality of the research, and provide cleaner work environments with less confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really more of a theme than a technology, but it made the list because the unifying &lt;strong&gt;Reproducible Research&lt;/strong&gt; “platform” coming out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riffomonas.org/reproducible_research/&quot;&gt;Pat Schloss lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, and others, is a technological resource that is ready to make a big impact on how biologists perform their research. I highly recommend checking this out and implementing some reproducible research practices in your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker, Julia, and the reproducible research platforms are not really new, but are all starting to improve the way computational and other biologists are doing their research. They are poised to make even larger impacts in the near future. These are technologies that are worth reading about, and even incorporating into research projects.&lt;/p&gt;

By beginning to understand the complementary roles that these microbial communities play in parallel with our human body, we are seeing many diseases with new perspectives. These new perspectives are already beginning to inform promising new therapies for truly terrible diseases (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile_infection&quot;&gt;Clostridium difficile infections&lt;/a&gt;). Although the microbiome consists of fungi, viruses, archaea, and other microbes, bacteria are by and large the most studied component of the human microbiome. The human virome (the viral component of the human microbiome) is understudied, but especially interesting because it consists primarily of bacteriophages (bacterial viruses), which are capable of modulating bacterial metabolism, function, and community composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/PhageIsolatesUrine.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many human anatomical site viromes have begun to be studied (gut, mouth, skin, lung). To date, the virome of the urinary bladder, another medically important body site, remains understudied. To address this large knowledge gap, a research group led by Taylor Miller-Ensminger &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, in the lab of Catherine Putonti at Loyola University, recently published a unique characterization of the human urinary virome using culturing and sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the authors pointed out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://jb.asm.org/content/early/2018/01/10/JB.00738-17.abstract?sid=839a52cb-ad17-4837-bcc6-73fc91d46a53&amp;amp;abspop=1&amp;amp;related-urls=yes&amp;amp;legid=jb;JB.00738-17v1&quot;&gt;their manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, previous studies have detected viruses in urine microbiome using &lt;a href=&quot;http://prophage.blogspot.com/2013/11/standing-on-shoulders-of-giants-brief.html&quot;&gt;shotgun metagenomic techniques&lt;/a&gt; (a standard microbiome characterization approach). What makes this work of Miller-Ensminger &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; unique and valuable is that they focus on identifying the prophages (those phages whose genomes are integrated into bacterial genomes) of the urine microbiome. This is valuable because it provides more information about the types of phages present in the urinary tract, and also gives information on what bacteria are likely to be infected by phages. The group accomplished this by culturing/isolating bacteria out of a human cohort and sequencing the isolate genomes. And in case you were thinking about &lt;em&gt;contamination&lt;/em&gt;, they used isolated from mid-stream urine collections, as well as aseptically collected with a transurethral catheter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group ended up with 181 genome assemblies from their collection of isolates, and they identified 226 high confidence phages integrated into those genomes. They were also able to isolate one of their phages out of their samples (see image above). In the end the group added a valuable survey of the lysogenic phages of human urine, and a reference of phages that are linked to their hosts. As the authors mention, this work is especially exciting because it will provide valuable reference material for future studies of the urine microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Phylogeny of the bacterial hosts that were used for identifying prophages.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting next step that I could envision would be to use the isolate prophage genome sequences with the previous urine metagenomic studies, or perform shotgun sequencing on the samples. It would be interesting to look at the ubiquity of those phages in other sample sets by aligning shotgun metagenomic reads to the prophage sequences. It would also be cool to use a similar approach to start understanding how many of those phages are actively replicating (or maybe only active in disease states). There are a lot of interesting directions for this work and I am excited to see the next study from the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this is a very nice paper that is easy to follow, so I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;http://jb.asm.org/content/early/2018/01/10/JB.00738-17.abstract?sid=839a52cb-ad17-4837-bcc6-73fc91d46a53&amp;amp;abspop=1&amp;amp;related-urls=yes&amp;amp;legid=jb;JB.00738-17v1&quot;&gt;checking it out&lt;/a&gt;. Their data is also published, so it might be worth integrating the sequences into your own future studies. And of course, please leave me a comment below if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Markdown is advantageous over platforms like Microsoft Word because it only uses a simple text file, it allows the writer to focus on content and not formatting, and it can be incorporated easily into reproducible science workflows (Markdown is a sort of code). My colleagues and myself have really enjoyed using Markdown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SchlossLab/Hannigan_CRCVirome_mBio_2017&quot;&gt;our own work&lt;/a&gt;, although the documents have primarily been research manuscripts. As I was preparing these types of manuscripts for submission to journals, I wanted to include a Markdown cover letter to accompany my Markdown manuscript. In this blog post I want to present the resulting cover letter Markdown template that I came up with and used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through two steps to get the template together. The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; was searching around and getting a base template on which I could build. This always makes the process of coding anything a lot faster and easier, although I unfortunately lost the original source, so I’m leaving out an important citation. The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; step was re-writing portions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org&quot;&gt;Latex&lt;/a&gt; template (the template used for formatting the Markdown file). I modified the template to be highly customizable within the Markdown file, without the need to further modify the complicated template code. I also included an executable shell script to automatically render the final PDF using Pandoc. The resulting PDF will include a header with author information and institute logo, the current data, a signature, and affiliation(s), all of which are easily specified in the Markdown text (remember to include back-slashes before special characters like parentheses). An example of the resulting document is included below, as well as the Markdown text used to create that document.&lt;/p&gt;

To date, the majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacteria, but microbiomes are actually complex communities that consist of fungi, archaea, viruses, and of course bacteria. The bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) component of the human microbiome is of particular interest to human health because of the profound influence bacteriophages have on bacterial community composition and functionality. As an example, phages facilitate bacterial virulence in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTXφ_bacteriophage&quot;&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.uconn.edu/mcbstaff/graf/Student%20presentations/EHEC/EHEC.html&quot;&gt;enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their importance, we are still just scratching the surface into how phages interact with the human body to impact health. By understanding these phage - bacteria - human interactions better, we can better understand how the microbiome impacts human health, and how we can create microbiome-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/phelix.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/xcf.jpg?resize=1154%2C902&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
A recent study led by Nguyen &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; provided some really cool new insight into how bacteriophages interact with their human body host. In their paper &lt;strong&gt;“Bacteriophage Transcytosis Provides a Mechanism To Cross Epithelial Cell Layers”&lt;/strong&gt;, published in mBio, the group described a mechanism to explain how phages access the human body, and consequently show up in unexpected “sterile” areas like blood and various organs. This is important because it provides insight into how phages might be interacting with the human body, despite their inability to actually infect human cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of the study was an experimental setup involving &lt;em&gt;apical&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;basal&lt;/em&gt; incubation chambers that were separated by a controlled human cell layer, as is outlined in their figure below. The group started by adding phages to either side of the membrane layer and showed that they could collect phages from the other side of the membrane. The fact that fewer phages could be collected from the apical side than basal suggested directionality to phages’ transportation. They ran this experiment with cells from the gut, lungs, liver, and brain, and observed the same degree of phage transport across the epithelial layer. They also made these observations using a variety of bacteriophages. The group followed up on these experiments with some very cool and extensive microscopy and molecular experiments to confirm that the observed phage transportation was mediated by transcytosis potentially through the Golgi apparatus. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbio.asm.org/content/8/6/e01874-17.short&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more of those details (it’s open access, so anyone can check it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/BarrierPhageSetup.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the authors pointed out, this is not the first time someone has demonstrated a mechanism by which bacteriophages could directly interact with human (eukaryotic) cells. Longtime reads will remember that we actually discussed an article in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://prophage.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-bacteriophage-as-vaccine-platform.html&quot;&gt;Prophage post&lt;/a&gt; about phage uptake into eukaryotic cells as a mechanism for gene delivery. Other mechanisms have included phage transport across damaged epithelial tissue, and even “Tojan Horse” phages that enter an epithelial cell by hiding in a bacterium that is engulfed. The novel aspect of this current paper is that they provide comprehensive and detailed information around the mechanism by which phages cross the epithelial cell layer by transcytosis, which allows them to access other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the next question is what these findings mean for human health and the microbiome/virome. A person’s mind could go wild speculating on the different ways that this mechanism could tie into human immunology, disease progression, etc, and these implications for future research are what make the paper especially exciting. However it is important to remember that these findings were done in cell culture (&lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;) and things could look very different in a real human system. It will be incredibly exciting to watch how this line of research progresses, but for now I think it’s a good idea to temper our expectations on how this is going to impact human health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds cool, I would suggest checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbio.asm.org/content/8/6/e01874-17.short&quot;&gt;manuscript online&lt;/a&gt;. It’s even open access, so it’s super easy to get the document. It’s a nice read and the authors really do present a lot of interesting data. And as always, let me know if I missed something or if you have a question, comment, or concern. Let me know in the comments below. Otherwise you can find me on Twitter, reach out by email, etc. I always love hearing from readers! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Phage" /><category term="Microbiome" /><category term="Virome" /><category term="Recent Research" /><summary type="html">Bacteriophage Transcytosis Provides a Mechanism To Cross Epithelial Cell Layers</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Whole New Blogging World</title><link href="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Whole New Blogging World" /><published>2017-11-18T14:13:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-18T14:13:00-05:00</updated><id>http://microbiology.github.io/blog/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/hello-world/">&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to the new Prophage blog site. If you’ve read the blog before, you know that the site used to be hosted by Google Blogger &lt;a href=&quot;http://prophage.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Prophage was active for many years and accumulated well over 100,000 views! It’s been exciting, but the old format was starting to get restricting. In an effort to deliver more and better designed content, I decided to make the switch to a GitHub hosted blog using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.hoosier-realtors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/moving-tips.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switch came at a good time, following a hiatus I took from blogging. In the past few months, I have been working to finish up a couple papers from my postdoctoral fellowship at Michigan, while also moving to Boston to start a new position in industry instead of academia. I joined the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merck.com/about/featured-stories/cambridge-mrl.html&quot;&gt;Merck Exploratory Science Center&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge and am very excited to be working on some super cool science!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will certainly keep updating the blog as it grows. Right now I am using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme&quot;&gt;awesome, open source theme&lt;/a&gt; to get started, but I will probably start customizing that as I move forward. I also don’t have my old blog posts transferred over, but that is something else that I am going to work on. For now, you can still see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://prophage.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;old blog posts here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and keep an eye out for some more awesome blog posts on the new site! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Welcome to the new Prophage blog site.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://microbiology.github.io{&quot;feature&quot;=&gt;nil}" /></entry></feed>

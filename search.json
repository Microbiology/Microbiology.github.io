      "excerpt"		: "The human microbiome, the collection of microbes that live in and on the human body, has continued to gain attention as an important influencer of human health and disease. To date, the majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacteria, but microbiomes are actually complex communities that consist of fungi, archaea, viruses, and of course bacteria. The bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) component of the human microbiome is of particular interest to human health because of the profound influence bacteriophages have on bacterial community composition and functionality. As an example, phages facilitate bacterial virulence in Cholera and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Despite their importance, we are still just scratching the surface into how phages interact with the human body to impact health. By understanding these phage - bacteria - human interactions better, we can better understand how the microbiome impacts human health, and how we can create microbiome-based therapies."

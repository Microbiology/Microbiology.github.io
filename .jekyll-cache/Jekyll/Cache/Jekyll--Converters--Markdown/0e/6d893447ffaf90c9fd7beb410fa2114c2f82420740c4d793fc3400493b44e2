I"Ï<p>Most of us probably appreciate the importance of publication in academia. In my experience, PhD programs generally require at least one first author publication to graduate (many require two). Postdocs pursue publications to advance their research and careers, and university labs focus on publishing as a key output of their research. This may sound familiar in the academic setting, but what about industry? What does publication look like for a scientist doing research in a company? Without being in industry, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s always clear how industry scientists balance publications with their other therapeutic priorities. In this post we will explore what it means to publish research in industry.</p>

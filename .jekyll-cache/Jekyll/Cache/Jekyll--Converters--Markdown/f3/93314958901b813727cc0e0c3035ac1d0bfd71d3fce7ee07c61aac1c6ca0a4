I"*<p>Bacteriophages (viruses that specifically infect bacteria) are important mediators of human health. The approach termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy">phage therapy</a> involves the use of phages to therapeutically to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria and thereby treat resistant, life-threatening infections. These phage-based approaches are also appealing in applications such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5609231/#mbt212783-bib-0021">“microbiome sparing” therapies</a> for infections, which means the specific infectious bacterium is killed by the phage and the overall community is impacted less than by an antibiotic treatment. For these reasons, it is important for us as a field to understand how phages infect their hosts, and how bacteria evade phage infections. A recently published manuscript by Sarah Kronheim <em>et al</em> addresses our knowledge gap of how bacteria combat phage infections by outlining a previously understudied chemical-based bacterial defense mechanism against phages.</p>

I"ü<p>Hello and welcome to the new Prophage blog site. If youâ€™ve read the blog before, you know that the site used to be hosted by Google Blogger <a href="http://prophage.blogspot.com">here</a>. Prophage was active for many years and accumulated well over 100,000 views! Itâ€™s been exciting, but the old format was starting to get restricting. In an effort to deliver more and better designed content, I decided to make the switch to a GitHub hosted blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.</p>

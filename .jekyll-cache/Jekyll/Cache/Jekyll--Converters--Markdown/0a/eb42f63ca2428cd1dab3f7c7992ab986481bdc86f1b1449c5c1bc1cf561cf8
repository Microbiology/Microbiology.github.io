I"~<p>Understanding and elucidating the links between the microbiome and human health is a complex problem, largely due to the complicated webs of interactions between members of the microbiome and the human host. One layer of this complicated system is the functionality of bacteria within the microbiome. Small molecules, often produced by microbial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), are an avenue many groups are now taking to further elucidate this functionality. As <a href="http://microbiology.github.io/blog/bgc-transcript-pnas/">we discussed in this blog before</a>, BGCs are clusters of co-localized genes that together encode the “machinery” needed to produce small molecules that can impact functionality of either human cells or other microbial cells. In this blog post we will discuss <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/2/e00321-19">the recently reported work of Aleti <em>et al</em></a>, in which they reported an analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the oral microbiome, and its association with oral disease. The group’s disease focus was on periodontitis and dental plaques, which are significant disease burdens.</p>

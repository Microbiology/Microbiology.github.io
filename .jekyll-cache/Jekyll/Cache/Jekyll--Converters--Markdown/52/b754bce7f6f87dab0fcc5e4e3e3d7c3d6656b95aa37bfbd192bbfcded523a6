I"«<p>Some challenges we can face as scientist are not just our experiments and analyses, but keeping organized and balancing the hundreds of things we have to do each day. There are lots of tools out there for keeping on top of our todo lists, but if you are like me, you have found it difficult to actually find one that sticks, and actually improves day-to-day life. After trying many different approaches and tools, Iâ€™ve really come to like the bullet journal strategy. Because I have found it to be such a game changer, I want to break away from the research heavy topics and share some of my experiences in how Iâ€™ve better enabled my science by improving my organization.</p>

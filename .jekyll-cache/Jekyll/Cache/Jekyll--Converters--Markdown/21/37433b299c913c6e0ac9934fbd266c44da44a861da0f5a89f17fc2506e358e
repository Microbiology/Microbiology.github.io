<p>Welcome to the <strong>Prophage</strong> blog 2.0! This is version 2.0 because it is a new location and structure of the original Prophage blog that started back in 2013. The old blog was very successful, with well over 100,000 views, but it was time to update the site.</p>

<p>This blog is written and maintained by Dr. Geoffrey Hannigan. Check out the latest blog entries below, navigate the site using the menu above, and check out the <a href="http://prophage.blogspot.com">original Prophage here</a>. Read more about Dr. Hannigan in the “about the author” section.</p>

In my experience, PhD programs generally require at least one first author publication to graduate (many require two). Postdocs pursue publications to advance their research and careers, and university labs focus on publishing as a key output of their research. This may sound familiar in the academic setting, but what about industry? What does publication look like for a scientist doing research in a company? Without being in industry, I don’t think it’s always clear how industry scientists balance publications with their other therapeutic priorities. In this post we will explore what it means to publish research in industry.</span></a></article></li>

How do we break into industry after graduating with our PhD or completing our postdoc? Making the move to industry can sometimes be a challenge, and this question of how is a big one. In this blog post we will build off of our previous post (career trajectory within industry) and discuss some ways to get started with pursuing a career in industry.</span></a></article></li>

For example we might find ourselves in a computational biology department but there are many other departments including statistics, drug modeling, molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, etc. Even further beyond this research scope are departments such as regulatory affairs, business development, marketing, supply chain, and the list goes on.</span></a></article></li>

There is what we can call the academic path (assistant professor, etc) but what about other paths like industry (pharma, biotech, etc)? I found (and I think many others do too) academia to be a bit clearer because we spend so much time in the University system during our scientific training. Conversely I think a lot of times industry can be a bit more of a black box, with details and perspectives somewhat elusive. Throughout my graduate and postdoc training, I really benefited from insightful, supportive, and generous colleagues who shared this information and helped me make an informed decision about where I wanted to go in my career. Since joining industry as a computational biologist after my postdoc, I’ve been passionate about paying it forward and trying to be a resource for others who want to learn more.</span></a></article></li>

I"<p>This year has shaped up to be a busy but exciting year, and one of these exciting parts has been the opportunity to publish some of my work in the human microbiome/virome space. A couple of weeks ago our research group (from when I was at the University of Michigan) had our colon cancer virome preprint fully published in mBio, and I am really excited to see it out. For this post I want to highlight that work and provide a little extra commentary about how I think it fits in the field and where the work is going.</p>

I"-<p>Getting motivated to do our science can be challenging. Likewise, if we are running a lab or other kind of research group, it can be challenging to cultivate and maintain an environment where we all feel fulfilled and motivated by our research. Recently I have been reading and reflecting on this topic, and the work from Daniel Pink has stood out. Pink is a popular writer and his work (most notably his book Drive) outlines three key “MAP” motivators: <strong>Mastery</strong> (we want to get better at stuff), <strong>Autonomy</strong> (we want to direct our lives), and <strong>Purpose</strong> (we want to contribute to something big and meaningful). For this post we will take some time to discuss and reflect on the MAP criteria for motivation, and how we can use them to motivate our research.</p>

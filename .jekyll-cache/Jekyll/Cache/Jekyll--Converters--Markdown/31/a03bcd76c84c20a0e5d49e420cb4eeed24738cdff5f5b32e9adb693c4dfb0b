I"§<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">RMarkdown</a> are great tools for writing scientific documents and manuscripts. Markdown is advantageous over platforms like Microsoft Word because it only uses a simple text file, it allows the writer to focus on content and not formatting, and it can be incorporated easily into reproducible science workflows (Markdown is a sort of code). My colleagues and myself have really enjoyed using Markdown in <a href="https://github.com/SchlossLab/Hannigan_CRCVirome_mBio_2017">our own work</a>, although the documents have primarily been research manuscripts. As I was preparing these types of manuscripts for submission to journals, I wanted to include a Markdown cover letter to accompany my Markdown manuscript. In this blog post I want to present the resulting cover letter Markdown template that I came up with and used.</p>

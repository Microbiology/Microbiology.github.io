I"ú<p>Itâ€™s no secret that the human microbiome (the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc that inhabit the human body) has provided unprecedented insights into human health and disease. By beginning to understand the complementary roles that these microbial communities play in parallel with our human body, we are seeing many diseases with new perspectives. These new perspectives are already beginning to inform promising new therapies for truly terrible diseases (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile_infection">Clostridium difficile infections</a>). Although the microbiome consists of fungi, viruses, archaea, and other microbes, bacteria are by and large the most studied component of the human microbiome. The human virome (the viral component of the human microbiome) is understudied, but especially interesting because it consists primarily of bacteriophages (bacterial viruses), which are capable of modulating bacterial metabolism, function, and community composition.</p>

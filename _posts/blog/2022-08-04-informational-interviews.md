How do people (especially scientists) figure out what career directions are a good fit? Is academia the right choice? Or what about industry, government, consulting, or something else? This incredibly important question can be incredibly difficult to answer. I went through this myself a few years ago as a postdoc, trying to discern the career direction that was best for me. While there are many ways to get a sense of career opportunities and direction, I found informational interviews to be one of the most effective approaches.

Informational interviews are simply connecting with someone in a field in which we might be interested, and asking them questions (interviewing them) to gain information on what their career is actually like. This can be a half hour chat at a local coffee shop with a local industry scientist, a Zoom call with a patent lawyer we met through our network, or something along those lines. The goal is to get information on what their career is like and inform whether that‚Äôs a direction we want to take.

Even if we get to the point where we have an informational interview scheduled, we may often find it‚Äôs confusing to know what questions to ask. To hopefully provide a **helpful resource** for getting started, in this blog post I wanted to collect some good questions I have come across or even asked myself. I also recently posed the question on Twitter of what questions people like to ask, and I‚Äôll include those in here as well because there are so many awesome suggestions!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Informational interviews are great for career development and can be really insightful into new fields and paths.

Susanna Harris, PhD made an important suggestion to take a little time to skim the person's LinkedIn before the interview. It can help you plan to frame your questions according to their experiences, and it's just generally appreciated by the people you will talk to. Logan Whitehouse mentioned that informational interviews can work best as a dynamic conversation. It's important to prepare some questions, but you also want to taylor the conversation to the flow of the discussion as well. These are really great pieces of advice!

Ultimately the informational interview can be a great tool for learning about potential new career paths. Hopefully this list of questions make the process a little easier as well. I you have any additional questions to add to the list, please let us know in the comment section.

Hello and welcome to the new Prophage blog site. If you've read the blog before, you know that the site used to be hosted by Google Blogger [here](http://prophage.blogspot.com). Prophage was active for many years and accumulated well over 100,000 views! It's been exciting, but the old format was starting to get restricting. In an effort to deliver more and better designed content, I decided to make the switch to a GitHub hosted blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The switch came at a good time, following a hiatus I took from blogging. In the past few months, I have been working to finish up a couple papers from my postdoctoral fellowship at Michigan, while also moving to Boston to start a new position in industry instead of academia. I joined the new [Merck Exploratory Science Center](https://www.merck.com/about/featured-stories/cambridge-mrl.html) in Cambridge and am very excited to be working on some super cool science!

I will certainly keep updating the blog as it grows. Right now I am using an [awesome, open source theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) to get started, but I will probably start customizing that as I move forward. I also don't have my old blog posts transferred over, but that is something else that I am going to work on. For now, you can still see the [**old blog posts here**](http://prophage.blogspot.com).

Thanks for reading, and keep an eye out for some more awesome blog posts on the new site! :)
